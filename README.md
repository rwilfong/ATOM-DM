This repository contains documentation for the ATOM team, which is part of The Data Mine - Corporate Partners at Purdue University. Contains example scripts on how to split datasets, build and train models, and perform hyperparameter optimization. Created with the help of the ATOM tutorials, which can be located here: https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL/tree/master/atomsci/ddm/examples/tutorials

For further documentation on what our team has completed, refer to the posters and videos we created for The Data Mine - Corporate Partners Symposium

*oprk1_model_example_split.ipynb*

Notebook that has an example of splitting an input dataset (80/10/10 split) and then creating and training a graph convolutional neural network

*hpo-example-oprm1*

Notebook has an example of creating a random forest model and then using a grid search for hyperparameter optimization. Then using a function to sort all of my created models by the ones that performed the best by the valid_r2_score. Then created a few data visualizations.
