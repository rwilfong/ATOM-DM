This repository contains example scripts on how to split datasets, build and train models, and perform hyperparameter optimization. Used as references for students in The Data Mine ATOM team to refer to. 

*oprk1_model_example_split.ipynb*

Notebook that has an example of splitting an input dataset (80/10/10 split) and then creating and training a graph convolutional neural network

*hpo-example-oprm1*

Notebook has an example of creating a random forest model and then using a grid search for hyperparameter optimization. Then using a function to sort all of my created models by the ones that performed the best by the valid_r2_score. Then created a few data visualizations.
